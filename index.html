    <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hello, I'm Brody Chan! I am an engineer and composer, Welcome to my website, a place where I share my projects and passions.
            I believe knowledge is most valuable when shared, which is why I write about topics ranging from engineering to music composition.
            These subjects reflect my curiosity and my desire to explore how creativity and logic intersect.
            Engineering allows me to solve real-world problems, while music composition gives me the freedom to express emotion and tell stories.
            By sharing my thoughts and experiences, I hope to spark curiosity, inspire creativity, and connect with like-minded individuals.</p>
