      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Hi, I’m Brody Chan—an engineer, musician, and creator. After earning my master’s degree in architectural engineering and working as an engineer for two years, I’ve decided to switch fields and pursue a degree in electrical engineering at Delft University of Technology. My interests lie in robotics, microchip design, and sustainable technology.</p><p>Beyond engineering, I’m also a classically trained pianist and composer. Here, I share my projects, research, and insights—whether it’s about electronics, music theory, or creative problem-solving.</p>
      <p>Join me as I explore new ideas and push the boundaries between engineering and music. Feel free to explore my work and reach out!</p>
